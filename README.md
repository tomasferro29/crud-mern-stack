This is my implementation of the MERN-Stack technique in a CRUD project.

## HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

Both backend and frontend have to be run in order to use the app locally.

- Backend: go to **MeLi-TC/meli-tc-b** and run **npm start** (runs on port 8080)
- Frontend: go to **MeLi-TC/meli-tc-f** and run **npm start** (runs on port 3000)

**npm install** is needed on both places in order to install required dependences.
